üëã Welcome to my Home Operations repository, **tnwks** /tee-networks/. This is a mono repository that serves as the foundation for my home infrastructure.

 I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

### Installation

The cluster is running on [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve), an open-source hypervisor built on top of Debian. [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io) is running on virtual machines within Proxmox. A [PVE Ceph Cluster](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Deploy_Hyper-Converged_Ceph_Cluster) is handling my VM storage, along with an [externally-connected](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.11/CRDs/Cluster/external-cluster/) implementation of [Rook Ceph](https://rook.io) that is providing my K8s workloads with persistent block, object, and file storage.


### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): Self-hosted Github runners.
- [cilium](https://cilium.io): Internal Kubernetes networking plugin.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over DNS.
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform which are commited to Git.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) and [snapscheduler](https://github.com/backube/snapscheduler): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ bootstrap     # Flux installation
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
```

### Cluster layout

Below is a a high level look at the layout of how my directory structure with Flux works. In this brief example you are able to see that `authelia` will not be able to run until `glauth` and `cloudnative-pg` are running. It also shows that the `Cluster` custom resource depends on the `cloudnative-pg` Helm chart. This is needed because `cloudnative-pg` installs the `Cluster` custom resource definition in the Helm chart.

```python
# Key: <kind> :: <metadata.name>
GitRepository :: k8s-gitops
    Kustomization :: cluster
        Kustomization :: cluster-apps
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-authelia
                DependsOn:
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-glauth
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg-cluster
                HelmRelease :: authelia
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-glauth
                HelmRelease :: glauth
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg
                HelmRelease :: cloudnative-pg
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg-cluster
                DependsOn:
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg
                Cluster :: postgres
```

### Networking

| Name                                         | CIDR            |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Kubernetes Nodes VLAN                        | `10.0.0.0/24`   |
| Kubernetes external services (Cilium w/ BGP) | `7.0.0.0/8`     |
| Kubernetes pods                              | `10.244.0.0/16` |
| Kubernetes services                          | `10.245.0.0/16` |

- [Cilium](https://cilium.io) is configured with the `io.cilium/lb-ipam-ips` annotation to expose Kubernetes services with their own IP over BGP which is configured on my router.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) provides a [secure tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) for [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to ingress traffic from the Internet into my Kubernetes cluster.

## üåê DNS

### Internal DNS

[blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) provides the first hop of DNS resolution inside my network. DNS requests to my public domain are forwarded to [k8s-gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) which checks to see if it's present in my cluster; if not, it talks out to [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) which is configured as my primary DNS provider.

### External DNS

[external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is deployed in my cluster and configured to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingresses this `external-dns` instance looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that have an annotation of `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`.

## ü§ù Gratitude and Thanks

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Home search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.
